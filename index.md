** What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been learning how to call APIs using various language models. It has been both fun and meaningful to practice proper techniques for interacting with APIs for large language models, enhancing our understanding of their functionality.
** Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to delve deeper into website and app development. Additionally, I’m interested in investigating how SQL queries can be integrated to assess and analyze data from grocery websites effectively.
** What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
In our Quarter 2 project, we are likely to transition to calling the OpenAI API, whereas our current Quarter 1 project focuses on testing APIs from SambaNova (https://sambanova.ai/) that leverage the LLaMA model.
** What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would like to incorporate the use of SQL queries and explore geolocation data in conjunction with API calls to GPT. This could add a spatial dimension to our analysis and enhance the project's capabilities.
